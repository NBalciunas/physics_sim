# Falling Sand Simulation

## Introduction
This is a simple falling sand simulation.
It is a game that lets you play around with diffrent elements to see how they interact with each other.
Each element has its own properties and the way they interact in diffrent scenarios.
It also allows you to view the temperatures of each material and see how the temperatures move.
Furthermore it has support for making and loading snapshots.

## OOP Pillars
### Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritence, Encapsulation
